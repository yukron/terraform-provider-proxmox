# Terraform provider plugin for Proxmox

This repository provides both a Terraform provider and provisioner for the [Proxmox virtualization platform](https://pve.proxmox.com/pve-docs/). 

## Getting started

In order to get started, use [the documentation included in this repository](docs/index.md). The documentation contains
a list of the options for both the provider and the provisioner. Moreover, there are some guides available how to combine
options and start specific VMs.

## Known Limitations

This section is here to both serve as a reminder to contributers of areas for improvement, but also as a "head's up" to users so you don't have to run into it and then find it buried in some logged issue.

* If an attribute within a `disk`, `network`, `vga`, or `serial` block of `proxmox_vm_qemu` is _not_ set by the user, the value will be stored in the terraform state as empty. Thus, it _cannot_ be used to, for example, get the macaddr generated by proxmox. Unfortunately this is a limitation due to our use of a schema.TypeSet and a computed attribute that (apparently) messes with terraform's ability to detect configuration drift and results in idempotence problems (a new diff on every terraform apply).  I don't know of a way around this (yet).
* `proxmox_vm_qemu`.`disk`.`size` attribute does not match what is displayed in the Proxmox UI.
* Updates to `proxmox_vm_qemu` resources almost always result as a failed task within the Proxmox UI. This appears to be harmless and the desired configuration changes do get applied.
* `proxmox_vm_qemu` does not (yet) validate vm names, be sure to only use alphanumeric and dashes otherwise you may get an opaque 400 Parameter Verification failed (indicating a bad value was sent to proxmox).
